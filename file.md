this is sample bio updated now

- so above text has total 30 characters and below is binary representation through Buffer and the Buffer also has 30 numbers

- Each number e.g. 74 68 represent a byte so the above string takes 30 bytes (240 bits)

# Buffer

For example, when reading from or writing to files, the data is often represented in the form of Buffer objects. Node.js allows you to manipulate and access these Buffer objects using various methods and functions.


<Buffer 74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 73 61 6d 70 6c 65 20 62 69 6f 20 75 70 64 61 74 65 64 20 6e 6f 77>


There are four numeric systems: decimal (base 10, 74), binary (base 2, 0b1110100), octal (base 8, Oo74) and hexadecial (base 16, Ox74)


- This is because Node.js (and many other programming environments) commonly represent binary data (like a Buffer) in hexadecimal format by default.
