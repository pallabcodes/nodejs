Let me address both points:

1. **Testing Bypass in package.json**:
Yes, I see that testing is currently bypassed with:
```json
"test": "echo \"No tests specified\" && exit 0"
```
This is fine for now since testing isn't a priority. The CI pipeline will still run but will pass the test step because of this bypass.

2. **CI/CD and CommitLint Setup**:

For the CI/CD to work, you need a few things:

a) **GitHub Repository Setup**:
- Push your code to a GitHub repository
- The repository must be public or you need to have GitHub Pro/Enterprise for private repos
- The workflows are in `.github/workflows/`, so they'll automatically be picked up

b) **CommitLint and Husky Setup**:
You already have the necessary packages:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@commitlint/cli": "^18.6.1",
    "@commitlint/config-conventional": "^18.6.2",
    "commitizen": "^4.3.0",
    "cz-conventional-changelog": "^3.3.0",
    "husky": "^9.0.11"
  }
}
```

To make it work:

1. **Initial Setup** (one-time setup):
```bash
# Initialize husky
npm run prepare

# Create commitlint config
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js
```

2. **Using Commits**:
You have two options:

a) Using `npm run commit` (interactive):
```bash
npm run commit
# This will start an interactive prompt asking for:
# - Type of change (feat, fix, etc.)
# - Scope
# - Description
# - Breaking changes
# - Issues affected
```

b) Using regular git commit (must follow convention):
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug in auth"
```

3. **CI/CD Authentication**:
For the CI/CD to work:

- For public repositories: No additional setup needed
- For private repositories: You need to add secrets in GitHub:
  1. Go to your repository settings
  2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
  3. Add any required secrets (like `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD` if you're pushing to Docker Hub)

4. **Current CI Pipeline**:
Your current CI pipeline will:
- Run on push to `main` and `develop` branches
- Run on pull requests to these branches
- Execute in this order:
  1. Lint (TypeScript and ESLint)
  2. Test (currently bypassed)
  3. Build (TypeScript and Docker)

5. **To Make it Work**:
```bash
# 1. Initialize git if not already done
git init

# 2. Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>

# 3. Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# 4. Make your first commit (using either method)
npm run commit
# or
git commit -m "feat: initial commit"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin develop
```

The CI/CD will automatically run when you:
- Push to `main` or `develop`
- Create a pull request to these branches
- No additional commands needed after initial setup

6. **Commit Message Format**:
Your commits must follow this format:
```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types allowed:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

Example valid commits:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT authentication"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve rate limiting issue"
git commit -m "docs: update README with setup instructions"
```

If you try to commit without following this format, Husky will reject the commit with an error message explaining what's wrong.

Would you like me to:
1. Add a pre-commit hook for additional checks?
2. Set up a more specific commit message template?
3. Add more CI/CD jobs for specific purposes?


## For now, CI/CD only enabled on `main` branch

I'll modify the CI workflow to only run on the main branch, but keep the develop branch configuration commented out for future use:



I've made the following changes:

1. **CI Workflow Changes**:
   - Now only runs on `main` branch
   - Kept `develop` branch configuration but commented out
   - Added clear comments for future enablement

2. **Added Future CD Template**:
   - Added a commented-out CD workflow template
   - Also includes commented `develop` branch configuration
   - Ready to be uncommented and customized when needed

Now the CI will:
- Only run on pushes to `main`
- Only run on PRs targeting `main`
- Skip `develop` branch completely

To enable CI for `develop` branch in the future:
1. Uncomment the `branches: [ main, develop ]` lines
2. Commit and push the changes

To enable CD in the future:
1. Uncomment the CD workflow section
2. Add your deployment steps
3. Commit and push the changes

This setup gives you:
- Clean CI runs only on `main` for now
- Easy way to enable `develop` branch CI when needed
- Template for CD workflow when you're ready to implement it
- Clear documentation of what can be enabled

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specific deployment steps in the CD template?
2. Add environment-specific configurations?
3. Add more detailed comments about the workflow?
